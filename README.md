Google Glass QR Code reader app
============

App for Google Glass that allows you to scan, and save for later QR Codes. It uses web service to recognize code from photo - Esponce.com.

###Use of an app
Just run it by saying "OK, glass" and "scan code" as an action name. First card allows you to scan new code (it will take a picture and analyze it), and to the right you have history scans as cards with date of scan.

###Final note
There is many possibilities to make this software better, but I wrote this as a fun with borrowed Google Glass'es, so I'm not being able to do so. I encourage you to fork, add new features and create pull request.
